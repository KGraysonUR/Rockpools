## Exercise 2 - Initial visualization

The box plot below shows wing length data for each of the 5 finch genera included in the Sato dataset. If you haven't worked with this kind of graph before you can [learn more about box plots here](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/boxplots.pdf).  

```{r fig.width=8.00, fig.height=5.54, dpi = 96, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
load("../data/dfmorph.rda")
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
dfmorph %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = GenusL69, y = WingL)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = GenusL69))
```
