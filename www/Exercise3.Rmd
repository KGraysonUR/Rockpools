## Exercise 3 - Data manipulation 
This dataset contains morphological, island, and taxonomic information about a lot of birds. Sometimes the data is not in the proper format to directly answer a question. For example, **how many distinct species are on each island?** This is shown in the following table.

```{r fig.width=8.08, fig.height=3.88, dpi = 96, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(kableExtra)
load("../data/dfmorph.rda")

dfmorph %>% 
  filter(Source == "Lack CAS") %>% 
  group_by(IslandID) %>% 
  summarize(SpeciesL69 = n_distinct(SpeciesL69)) %>%
  kable(align = "l",
        col.names = c("Island ID",
                      "Species L69")) %>%
  kable_styling("bordered", full_width = F) %>%
  row_spec(0, background = "#EEE") %>% 
  row_spec(1:28, background = "white")
```

Now use the "Analyze > Statistical Summaries" tab to try to recreate these results. Once this is done, ask a different question that requires some data processing and include your results below.
